# How to use the CloseOpens.rb plugin for SketchUp
 
If you are a SketchUp user, you may have encountered some problems with your models having holes or gaps in the faces. This can cause issues when you want to apply materials, export to other formats, or perform boolean operations. Fortunately, there is a handy plugin that can help you fix these problems: CloseOpens.rb.

CloseOpens.rb is a plugin created by Jim Foltz that automatically finds and closes small openings in your model. It works by selecting a face and then running the plugin from the context menu. The plugin will scan the edges of the face and look for any gaps that are smaller than a specified tolerance. If it finds any, it will create new faces to fill them in. You can adjust the tolerance value in the plugin's dialog box.
 
To use the CloseOpens.rb plugin, you need to install it first. You can download it from [SketchUcation](https://sketchucation.com/plugin/619-closeopens) or [SketchUp Extension Warehouse](https://extensions.sketchup.com/extension/9c2c0f7d-0b9c-4f3e-8f0e-3f4b8d5c6b5a/closeopens). Then, follow these steps:
 
1. Open SketchUp and go to Window > Extension Manager.
2. Click on the Install Extension button and browse to the location where you saved the CloseOpens.rb file.
3. Select the file and click OK.
4. Restart SketchUp to activate the plugin.

Now you are ready to use the CloseOpens.rb plugin. Here is how:

1. Select a face that has holes or gaps in it.
2. Right-click on the face and choose Close Small Openings from the context menu.
3. A dialog box will appear where you can enter the tolerance value. The default is 0.01 inches, but you can change it to suit your needs. The smaller the value, the smaller the gaps that will be closed.
4. Click OK and wait for the plugin to do its magic.
5. Check your model and see if all the holes or gaps are gone. If not, you can undo and try again with a different tolerance value.

The CloseOpens.rb plugin is a simple but powerful tool that can save you a lot of time and frustration when working with SketchUp models. It can also improve the quality and accuracy of your models. Try it out and see for yourself!
  
There are some limitations and caveats to using the CloseOpens.rb plugin. First of all, it only works on planar faces, meaning that the face must lie on a flat plane. If the face is curved or warped, the plugin will not work. Second, the plugin may create unwanted faces if the gaps are too large or irregular. In that case, you may need to manually delete or edit the faces. Third, the plugin may not work on complex or corrupted models. If your model has too many edges, faces, or groups, the plugin may fail or take too long to run. You may need to simplify your model or fix any errors before using the plugin.
 
Another thing to keep in mind is that the CloseOpens.rb plugin is not a substitute for good modeling practices. You should always try to avoid creating holes or gaps in your model in the first place. This can be done by using accurate measurements, snapping to endpoints and intersections, and using tools like Follow Me and Push/Pull properly. You should also check your model for errors regularly by using tools like Solid Inspector or CleanUp. These tools can help you identify and fix any problems with your model.
 
The CloseOpens.rb plugin is a great addition to your SketchUp toolbox. It can help you fix small openings in your model quickly and easily. However, it is not a magic solution that can solve all your modeling problems. You still need to use good modeling techniques and check your model for errors. By doing so, you can create better and more realistic models with SketchUp.
