Black Butler Season 2 is a continuation of the first season, but with a twist. The second season features two new main characters: Earl Alois Trancy and his butler Claude Faustus. Alois is a sadistic and spoiled young boy who has a mysterious past and a grudge against Ciel Phantomhive. Claude is a cold and ruthless demon who serves Alois, but also has a hidden interest in Ciel's soul.
 
The second season follows the rivalry and conflict between the two pairs of master and servant, as they try to outsmart and outwit each other. Alois and Claude scheme to lure Ciel and Sebastian into their trap, while Ciel and Sebastian try to uncover the truth behind Alois' motives and Claude's betrayal. Along the way, they encounter old enemies and allies, such as the Queen's Watchdog, the Grim Reapers, and the Noah's Ark Circus.
 
The second season also reveals more about Ciel's past and his contract with Sebastian. It turns out that Ciel's soul was stolen by Claude before Sebastian could devour it, which caused Ciel to lose his memory of everything that happened after his parents' death. Sebastian had to restore Ciel's memory by recreating the events of the first season, but with some changes. However, Ciel's soul was also tainted by Alois' contract with Claude, which made it more appealing to both demons.
 
The second season ends with a climactic showdown between Ciel and Alois, and Sebastian and Claude. Ciel manages to defeat Alois and reclaim his soul, but he also realizes that he has no more reason to live after fulfilling his revenge. He decides to let Sebastian eat his soul as per their contract, but Sebastian has other plans. He turns Ciel into a demon himself, so that he can never consume his soul. The two then leave the human world together, leaving behind their friends and foes.
